# Bella Vita Media App

Bella Vita is a group-based social media app built with **React Native**, **JavaScript**, and **Firebase**. It lets users share photos in groups, like posts, comment, and view profiles, creating a fun way to stay in touch with family and friends.

## 1. Project Description

Bella Vita helps users share photos and chat in organized groups, rather than cluttered group chats. It provides a smoother social media experience with features like liking and commenting on posts.

### Key Features:
- **Group-based Sharing:** Users can post photos in groups, keeping everything organized.
- **Likes and Comments:** Users can like and comment on posts.
- **User Profiles:** Each user has group-specific profiles that others can view.
- **Push Notifications:** Users receive notifications when other users post, like, or comment.

### Why These Technologies?
- **React Native:** Cross-platform support for both iOS and Android.
- **Firebase:** Real-time database and cloud storage to manage posts and photos.

### Challenges Faced
- **Performance:** Optimizing image uploads/downloads and keeping the app fast for all users.
- **Firebase Security:** Setting up security rules to protect user data.
- **UI/UX:** Regularly improving the design based on user feedback.

## 2. Inspiration

I created Bella Vita to solve the chaos of sharing photos in group chats. I wanted to build a solution that was more organized while learning React Native and Firebase.

## 3. How Bella Vita Works

Bella Vita works like a group chat but with social media features. Users can:
1. **Create Groups** for friends or family.
2. **Post Photos** in those groups.
3. **Like and Comment** on posts.
4. **View User Profiles** to see what theyâ€™ve shared.

## 4. Potential Future Features
- **Video Sharing**
- **Private Messaging**
- **Activity Feed**

## 5. Lessons Learned

I improved my mobile development skills and learned how to collect and act on user feedback to make better decisions for the app.

Bella Vita Media solves the common problem of disorganized group photo sharing and gave me valuable experience with React Native and Firebase.
